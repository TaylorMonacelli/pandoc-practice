-   [mytest](t8.org)
-   [file:t8.org::sect42](t8.org::sect42)

-   This works in org-mode, but not in webui

-   This doesn't work in emacs org-mode linking, but works in
    webui links.

<!-- -->

    [[#sect22][link to section 22]]

which creates this: [link to section 22](#sect22)

but this has a problem. Emacs org-mode linking doesnt work here.

-   This doesn't work in emacs org-mode linking, but works in
    webui links.

<!-- -->

    [[file:t8.md#sect22][link to section 22]]

which creates this: [link to section 22](t8.md#sect22)

This has a problem. The output file is t8.md, but the source file is
t8.org so you've broken emacs org-mode linking in an effort to get web
linking working.

-   This doesn't work in emacs org-mode linking or webui links.

<!-- -->

    [[t8.md#sect22][link to section 22]]

which creates this: *link to section 22*

-   This doesn't work:

<!-- -->

    [[file:t8.md#Sect22][link to section 22]]

which creates this: [link to section 22](t8.md#Sect22)

-   This doesn't work

<!-- -->

    <<myanchor>> along with [[file:t8.md#myanchor][link to my anchor]]

which creates this: [link to my anchor](t8.md#myanchor)

-   This doesn't work

<!-- -->

    <<myanchor>> along with [[#myanchor][link to my anchor]]

which creates this: [link to my anchor](#myanchor)

-   This is crappy to link from t8.md to t8.org. Don't switch files.

<!-- -->

    [[file:t8.org#sect22][link to section 22]]

which creates this: [link to section 22](t8.org#sect22)

-   This works in emacs, but not in webui.

<!-- -->

    <<myanchor>> along with [[myanchor][link to my anchor]]

which creates this: [link to my anchor](#myanchor)

-   Works in emacs, but not in webui

<!-- -->

    <<myanchor1>> along with [[myanchor1][link to my anchor1]]

which creates this: [link to my anchor1](#myanchor1)

-   Doesn't work in emacs org-mode or in webui

<!-- -->

    <<myanchor>> along with [[file:t8.org::#myanchor]]

which creates this: [file:t8.org::\#myanchor](t8.org::#myanchor)

-   Doesn't work in emacs org-mode or in webui

<!-- -->

    <<myanchor>> along with [[file:./t8.org::#myanchor]]

which creates this: [file:./t8.org::\#myanchor](./t8.org::#myanchor)

So, in summary, I don't know how to write org-mode syntax such that
pandoc output will generate linkable markdown and still have emacs
org-mode links still work
-   must have file: prefix
-   drawback: even though you're documenting in t8.org, you must link to
    the target

<!-- -->

    [[file:t8.org#sect22][link to section 22]] # instead of this
    [[file:t8.md#sect22][link to section 22]]  # you must use this

-   must have lowercase section name. Instead of `file:t8.md#Sect22`,
    use `file:t8.md#sect22`
-   you can only link to sections within the document, you cant create
